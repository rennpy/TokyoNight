# TokyoNight v2
Aliucord Theme inspired by the [TokyoNight.nvim](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) colorscheme

### Why v2?
There was a theme under the same name made back in 2021, although it looks nothing like this one and is quite dated (you do not want to use it), though you can have a [screenshot](https://files.catbox.moe/4g977d.png)
if you want to compare it to this for some reason.
